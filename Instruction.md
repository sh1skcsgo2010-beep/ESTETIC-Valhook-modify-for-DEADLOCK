Installing and configuring the cheat is pretty straightforward:

    Download the latest version from the GITHUB (.exe)
    Unzip the archive to a convenient location on your computer;
    Run the cheat after starting the game (before entering the rink);
    Configure the functions for yourself using the cheat menu (it works on Insert).

Advanced users can create their own scripts. The cheat API allows you to write your own logic to automate actions.
